	<h1>Run Minima</h1>

	<h2>Step 1</h2>
	Install Open Web Start - the new updated version of Java Web Start<br>
	<br>
	<a href='https://openwebstart.com/download/' target='_blank' >Download Open Web Start</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Step 2</h2>
	Download the Minima JNLP file.. and open / double-click it.. this will install as an application and update automagically when you start it in future..<br>
	<br>
	<a href='minima.jnlp'>Minima JNLP</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Windows</h3>
	On windows the procedure should work almost seamlessly. The JNLP will be opened automatically by Open Web Start.<br>
	<br>
	If NOT - right click on the file and choose 'Open With' and select Open Web Start.
	<br>
	<h3>Mac</h3>
	If you install OpenWebStart FOR ALL USERS, which requires admin rights and will ask for a password, the file association works so that when you click the JNLP file it opens it correctly with OpenWebStart and not Java.<br>
	<br>
	If you install just for you - the file association does not seem to work.. so you will need to Command+Right Click the JNLP and choose OpenWebStart to open the file..<br>
	<br>
	If you chosse 'Other' - you can then set it as the default option so the next time it does it automatically..<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	You can do this..
