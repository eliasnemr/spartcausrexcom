	<div style="text-align:left;width:400;">
	I am a coder. Have been for 40 years now.. Sharp as a razor.. but getting old.. lol<br>
	<br>
	Started in Games (as many of us did back then) physics engines, 3D rendering, control systems etc etc..<br>
	<br>
	And since then have worked in almost every field.. web, html, php, mysql, javascript, telephony, apache, linux servers.. etc etc<br>   
	<br>
	After a while - all the languages blur into one. Each one suited to a different task.<br>
	<br>
	They call this - Full Stack.<br>
	<br>
	The last 20 years I have been mostly a Java man.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	My current <i>obsession</i> is <b>Minima</b>.<br>
	<br>
	The white paper is <a href="minima_whitepaper.pdf" download>here</a><br>
	<br>
	The complete code base can be found at <a href="https://github.com/minima-global/Minima">https://github.com/minima-global/Minima</a><br>
	<br>
	You can run a node very simply using the Java Network Lauch Protocol.. full instructions <a href="./javaws/index.html">here</a><br>
	<br>
	I have a list of self-updating peers you can add to your node at <b>https://spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt</b><br>
	Which you can add directly (instead of an actual host:ip list) in the Peers section of Settings in MiniHUB or from the command line with :<br>
	<br>
	<code>peers action:addpeers peerslist:https://spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt</code><br>
	<br>
	I run an archive server on <b>spartacusrex.com:8888</b><br>
	Which you can access from the Security MiniDAPP or from the command line with :<br>
	<br>
	<code>archive action:resync host:spartacusrex.com:8888</code><br>
	<br>
	And I make daily archive file backups in the <a href="./archive">archive folder</a><br>
	Which you can use to resync your node in Security MiniDAPP or command line.. with or without the seed phrase<br>
	<br>
	<code>archive action:import file:minima_archive_2023_09_04.gzip</code><br>
	<br>
	Enjoy!
