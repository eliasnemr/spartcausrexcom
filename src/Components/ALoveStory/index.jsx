          Hello. I'm Spartacus Rex. The guy who wrote Minima. Paddy Cerri is
          just the pseudonym I use in the real world, not the digital one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been programming since the ZX Spectrum 48K at the ripe old age of
          nine. Owned almost every computer since then, worked in almost every
          computer industry since then, and before starting Minima, was a
          full-stack programmer contracting to the highest bidder. To be
          absolutely clear gaming is by far the most fun a coder can have. SQL
          is at the bottom of the stack.
        </p>

          I fell in love with Bitcoin in 2012, and that love affair has never
          really stopped. Throw BitcoinTalk into the mix, the most opinionated,
          irreverent, intelligent, conspiratorial, mathematical, programmatic,
          dumb-ass, frustrating, interesting, and diverse group of individuals
          it has ever been my absolute pleasure to encounter, and there's no
          escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first cracks in our relationship started to appear after The
          Segwit Wars. It became clear to me then that there were different
          interested parties. That we were not all on the same page. Not all in
          the same boat. Miners and Users were two very distinct groups. Not one
          and the same. At this point, some may be thinking Well DUH! you didn't
          know that already !?. Nope it took a good kick to finally see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a bit player, not an equal. I was a User, not a Miner. The
          mantra started. VERIFY don't TRUST! Yes, yes obviously that is
          important, but verifying has nothing to do with anti-censorship. Sure
          no one is going to stuff an invalid transaction down my nodes' throat,
          but my full node has ZERO influence on which valid transactions are
          actually in the blocks. Only the miners decide that. And that stung.
          That hurt. That gnawed at the back of my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin mining is an industry. Like every other industry on the
          planet. And like every other industry on the planet, it's susceptible
          to Economies of Scale. It has nothing to do with clever maths, nothing
          to do with clever cryptography, nothing to do with the Will of the set
          of full validating nodes or the other miners. There is only one way
          that the Bitcoin Mining industry ends. One miner. And nothing anyone
          has ranted about since then has convinced me otherwise. The beauty of
          permissionless PoW mining is exactly the fact that it is so hard to
          control and regulate, the only way we currently deal with large
          monopolies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin miners, whether one or many, are clearly strongly incentivized
          to play fair. Absolutely. But the state-level attack is the one to
          watch out for, not the miner attack. If or When Bitcoin actually
          threatens the Chinese Yuan or the US Dollar, are these all-powerful
          institutions just going to sit back and admit defeat? Of course not.
          This will only matter when it matters. Plenty of viable attacks.

          And so... Minima. Deep down I think the urge is in all of us. All of
          us Coders anyway. Always has been. As a Coder, how could I not try and
          write my own version of Bitcoin. My vision of a better version of
          Bitcoin. Frankly, as a Coder, I would be derelict in my duties if I
          did not attempt to better Bitcoin. The ultimate programmatic life
          form. The ultimate piece of code. How can any coder resist? It's too
          much. It's intoxicating. I didn't realize how absolute this desire was
          until I started coding up my own version.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won't go into the technical details of Minima, all of that is in the
          White Paper, and soon the as-yet-unfinished Yellow Paper will explain
          it in microscopic detail, along with the release of the first test-net
          and source code. But I wanted to ensure that what I felt was happening
          to Bitcoin, would never happen to Minima.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minima was designed by me, for ME. Minima is the cryptocurrency I want
          to be using. In this regard I don't care about anyone else. If it's
          not for you, so be it. I won't be losing any sleep over it. There's
          plenty of rubbish out there to choose from. Take your pick.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Bitcoin. The root of all crypto. My first love. I do lose sleep
          over that. The anguish is very real. The torment that somehow I am
          betraying something so wonderful. Because despite the problems I have
          with Bitcoin, it is wonderful, and brilliant, and has utterly changed
          the world for the better. My feelings on that will never change. Come
          what may.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Minima Team has grown. Our office is full of people. It is no
          longer just me, down the hole, tap tap tapping away at my keyboard.
          Others believe too. I have no idea how this story ends. But it's
          truly, madly, deeply, getting exciting now.
