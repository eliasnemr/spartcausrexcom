      "There is a comic. Written by the genius Alejandro Jodorowsky (...and equally well illustrated by Juan Gimnez). A space fantasy that tells the tale of a family of ultimate warriors. The MetaBarons. They are undefeated and undefeatable. The Title of MetaBaron is passed down from one generation to the next. The hard truth though is that the MetaBaron title can only be won through combat, it cannot be given. It must be taken. The child must defeat the parent to assume the title. The new must defeat the old. When the child reaches �age� they fight and only if the child wins and lives.. do they become the next MetaBaron.",
